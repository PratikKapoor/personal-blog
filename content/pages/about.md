Hello! My name is Pratik Kapoor. I‚Äôm a Manipal survivor. I am a 24 year old who lives is Bangalore, India. I am an SDE at Amazon where my work directly contributes to empowering the next billion users to harness the power of the web. I‚Äôm a stable genius. Everybody loves me. I‚Äôm ahead in the polls. #Winner

When not at work, I spend my time in the gym lifting things and flying FPV racing drones (Check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0ZdfLDZQZPToWw3_Urj5A)!)

I am a builder at heart, which has manifested itself as me becoming a software developer by profession. I love tinkering with software and hardware, more so than actually using the final artifacts. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of hours I‚Äôve spent poring over a laptop trying to get a piece of software to work, only to be immediately disinterested once I actually do get it to work üòê

This is my personal blog and all thoughts and opinions published here are my own.
