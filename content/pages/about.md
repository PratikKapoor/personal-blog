Hello! My name is Pratik Kapoor. I’m a Manipal survivor. I am an SDE at Amazon where my work directly contributes to empowering the next billion users to harness the power of the web. I’m a stable genius. Everybody loves me. I’m ahead in the polls. #Winner
 
When not at work, I spend my time in the gym lifting things and flying FPV racing drones (Check out my IG - @propwash_fpv).

Currently, I am based out of Bangalore, India. You can find out more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratik-kapoor-ab636687/).

This is my personal blog and all thoughts and opinions published here are my own.
