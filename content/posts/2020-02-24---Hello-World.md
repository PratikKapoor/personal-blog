There probably exist 10 versions of this post in my Evernote notebook by now. I have been meaning to setup a website-slash-blog for quite a while now. I am definitely going to start posting this week, or so I keep telling myself. Until now.

##A bit about me

My name is Pratik Kapoor. I‚Äôm a Manipal survivor. I am a 24 year old who lives is Bangalore, India. I am an SDE at Amazon where my work directly contributes to empowering the next billion users to harness the power of the internet.

When not at work, I spend my time in the gym lifting things and flying FPV racing drones (Check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0ZdfLDZQZPToWw3_Urj5A)!)

I am a builder at heart, which has manifested itself as me becoming a software developer by profession. I love tinkering with software and hardware, more so than actually using the final artifacts. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of hours I‚Äôve spent poring over a laptop trying to get a piece of software to work, only to be immediately disinterested once I actually do get it to work üòê

##Why a blog you ask?

I have been a part of the Software Development community for the better part of the last decade. Initially as a student, and lately as a professional. It would be an understatement to say that I have learnt a ton from developer blogs from other engineers. I realise the importance of good developer blogs and the impact they create and hope to emulate and learn from thought leaders in this space through this medium. Having a medium to express my thoughts also helps me exist in the developer community in a broader manner, than just within Amazon.

##But what do I have to share?

It is largely known that the developer community as a whole suffers from imposter syndrome. Inspite of realising that, I am no different. I do not want to let it hold me back from sharing though, and I also hope to overcome it. I have had professional experience developing products used by millions, if not billions of users across the world and numerous internships under my belt. Surely I know a thing or two by now which could help other developers.

For the past year, I have been mentoring some of my peers looking to break into the Software Development industry, and more specifically, some of the bigger tech companies. I realised through multiple sync-up sessions and mock interviews that I had knowledge others could benefit from. Through this medium, I hope to be a force multiplier and reach out to as many people as possible which is inherently not possible via face-to-face interaction.

It would be remiss for me to not mention my personal motivation for writing. I aim to document my learnings and track my progress through my blog. I also am super eager to meet like-minded people who share my love for technology, and be able to use the community as a sounding board for any crazy ideas I have.

##What I plan to write about.

Whatever seems to have my attention at the moment! I have multiple passions - programming, drone racing, fitness, to name a few.

Primarily, however, I intend to write about the different technologies I work with and am exposed to as part of my job as a developer. Apart from my professional experience, I try to actively contribute to the open source community and the developer community in general through talks and code contributions.

I look to you, readers, to leave critical feedback that helps me grow and pushes me to create content that makes you stick around. 

Until next time,
Pratik Kapoor
