description: "What better time than a lockdown to dust off those Problem-Solving skills?"
---

How would you choose to spend a month if you were stuck at home with a deluge of extra time saved by not dealing with Bangalore traffic? I worked on the 30-day Leetcode challenge all of April and thought I'd share my what I got out of it. First off, thanks to Leetcode for this daily challenge and the otherwise locked questions that they made available during this time. Much needed distraction during the lockdown.

Iâ€™ll get the solutions out of the way for the people who might be looking for those (finally!)

Solutions - https://github.com/PratikKapoor/Leetcode-Challenge

That's the GitHub repository that has not only the accepted solutions, but also my sub-optimal (and on many days better than the required) solution. I have tried adding all solutions that struck me for the particular problem and was able to implement here. These should be helpful for someone looking to understand the process that goes behind building on top of a sub-optimal solution.

Everyday work as an SDE involves a ton of problem solving, but of a different variety. I find myself thinking of system design, experiment constructs, release strategies, and dependency management much more than low-level code optimisations. Naturally, you lose touch with the LeetCode style algorithmic problems. I really enjoyed solving those back in college and thought it would be great to dust off those parts of my brain. To be realistic though, they did a great job of gamifying it, which is  probably the biggest reason why I stuck with it through the end. It became a habit to see the green tick each day.

Can you believe that?! I had to have it and be the coolest kid on the block (read: office building)

By the end of it though, I got back in touch with a ton of data structures, operating systems, and other concepts back from my undergrad in CS. The one question a day spiralled into many more in my quest to reach the best possible solution each day. And what was unexpected was that this helped me realise opportunities where systems I owned could be improved. I incorporated some really cool ideas from a problem I came across which utilised a sliding window algorithm into a LLD system design document I was working on.

Month end rolled around, and the winner was announced. And it was *drumroll* not me. What a waste! Never going to fall for this ever again. Wait a minute, do they have a May challenge now? Winner gets one LeetCode Cap! Thatâ€™s insane!! I need to have it.

Be on the lookout for the May repo ðŸ˜„ The GitHub link is on the homepage.
